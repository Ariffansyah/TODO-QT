# TODO-QT

A data structure project for college, implemented in C++ with Qt.

## Description

This project serves as a practical exploration of data structures using C++ and the Qt framework. It is designed for educational purposes, helping students understand core data structure concepts through hands-on implementation.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Qt
- Implementation of fundamental data structures (e.g., lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- Example operations and visualizations
- Modular and extensible C++ codebase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- [Qt 5 or 6](https://www.qt.io/download)
- CMake (version 3.10 or newer)

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ariffansyah/TODO-QT.git
    cd TODO-QT
    ```

2. Configure the project with CMake:

    ```bash
    cmake -B build
    ```

3. Build the project:

    ```bash
    cmake --build build
    ```

4. Run the application:

    - On Linux/macOS:
      ```bash
      ./build/TODO-QT
      ```
    - On Windows: Run the generated `.exe` from the build directory.

### Usage

- Launch the application.
- Use the GUI to interact with and visualize various data structures.
- Choose operations (insert, delete, search, etc.) to see how the data structures behave.
